 * Author: Zubair Ab Aziz
 * Assignment: Project 2
 * Lab Section: MW, 1230-1345
 * TA Name: Sofia
 * Collaboration: I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment


##General comments
* I used only one class but a lot of different methods before the main method
* The game starts with the player picking between two golf courses
* Then they select golf clubs and power
* once they are close enough, they start putting
* when the ball reaches the hole, the game starts with the next hole
* game ends when 18th hole is cleared

##Problems with the code
* Not enough commands to properly give the player instructions
* Nothing to fall back on if the player enters something besides the requested ints
